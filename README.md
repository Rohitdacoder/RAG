# RAG Information Extraction System

## Introduction

The RAG Information Extraction System is a Python-based project designed to retrieve, summarize, and answer questions on various topics using the Retrieve, Answer, Generate (RAG) technology. This system employs several technologies and libraries to perform tasks such as web scraping, text summarization, question answering, and similarity search.

## Technologies Used

### 1. Google Custom Search API
   - Utilized for web scraping to retrieve relevant information from webpages based on user queries.

### 2. PineconeDB
   - Used for vector indexing and similarity search, enabling efficient retrieval of documents based on their content similarity.

### 3. Transformers Models
   - Employed for text summarization and question answering tasks. The system utilizes pretrained models like BERT and MiniLM for these purposes.

## Usage

To use the RAG Information Extraction System:
1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Enter a query related to the topic of interest.
3. The system will retrieve relevant information from the web and summarize it.
4. Optionally, you can ask questions related to the retrieved information, and the system will attempt to answer them.

## Problem Statement

The RAG Information Extraction System addresses the challenge of efficiently retrieving, summarizing, and answering questions on vast amounts of information available on the web. With the exponential growth of online content, users often face difficulties in finding relevant and concise information on specific topics. The RAG technology aims to streamline this process by automating the extraction and summarization of relevant information, thereby saving time and effort for users.

## Practical Usage Scenarios

1. **Research and Study**: Students and researchers can use the system to gather information on various topics for their studies and projects.
2. **News Aggregation**: Media organizations can employ the system to aggregate and summarize news articles on current events and trending topics.
3. **Content Curation**: Content creators and marketers can utilize the system to curate relevant content for their audiences, saving time on manual research.
4. **Customer Support**: Companies can integrate the system into their customer support platforms to provide quick and accurate answers to common queries.
5. **Competitive Analysis**: Businesses can use the system to gather intelligence on competitors by analyzing public information available online.

## Conclusion

The RAG Information Extraction System leverages advanced technologies to streamline the process of retrieving, summarizing, and answering questions on vast amounts of online information. By automating these tasks, the system enables users to efficiently access relevant information for various purposes, ranging from research and study to content curation and competitive analysis.
